This program is used for callibrating astronomical images in a .FITS format, as is the standard in astronomy.

Providing a stack of callibration images of bias', flats and darks, this program will callibrate a target image (light), such that the images
may then be used for differential photometry.

methods include:
creating mean or median averages of image stacks.
subtracting one image from another (e.g. removing bias and darks from flats)
dividing one image by another - e.g. flat division of lights
