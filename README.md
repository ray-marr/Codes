// This is a list of programs I have created

StarsAngle - calculates the angular seperation between stars of given RA and Dec

exponentialmethod - Calculates the exponential of a number via Taylor expansion method

ExtractSkyCounts - splits string copied cells from an excel file into an array and then outputs relevant Counts cells. Also does some calculations to detmine flux, magnitudes and colour (B-V). Also added a check with an error message if strings are different sizes.
